# Overview
Using the RunPod platform to deploy a serverless endpoint running a machine learning model. The endpoint should be capable of receiving a request and generating a corresponding response.


## runPod_case_study

RunPod is a powerful and cost-effective cloud platform designed for AI and machine learning workloads. It offers on-demand GPU instances, allowing users to access high-performance compute resources when needed. With its serverless computing capabilities, RunPod enables autoscaling API endpoints, making it easy to scale inference for AI models efficiently.

The platform provides AI endpoints tailored for inference workloads, ensuring seamless deployment and execution of machine learning models. Additionally, RunPod allows users to manage software on third-party compute resources while benefiting from dynamic scaling to meet computational demands effectively.

## Objectives

- Write a handler.py file that can handle serverless requests for the given model.

- Build a Docker image that includes your serverless handler and the model.

- Deploy a serverless endpoint on the RunPod platform.

- Test that the serverless endpoint is able to receive an input (via text) and return an appropriate image for display
